# Coffee-Menu

This assignment is about cleaning up a menu data for a coffee chain and filtering it based on specific guidelines using higher-order functions like map() and filter(). We will start by creating a new repository and pasting the given menu data into a file named coffee_data.js. Then, we will fix the data in the file by converting all prices into numbers, making sure all items are strings, and adding commas to separate objects and properties. After that, we will create a new file named index.js and import the coffee_data.js file into it using the require syntax. We will complete six prompts in the index.js file, starting with printing an array of all the drinks on the menu, followed by filtering drinks that cost $5 and under, drinks that are priced at an even number, drinks that are seasonal, and calculating the total cost of ordering one of every drink. Finally, we will print an array of all the seasonal drinks with the words "with imported beans" after their names. Throughout the assignment, we will use console.log() and console.table() to check our work.
